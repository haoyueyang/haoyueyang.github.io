title: "Community Service"
---

In the past 7 years, I usually spent 2-4 hours per week on university and community service.
My volunteering experiences mostly focus on three minority groups: children from low-income families, the aged with health problems, 
and patients suffering from mental health issues. In particular, I care about patients with autism and depression. At the same time,
I also worked for promoting Chinese cultural and academic exchange. 

These are some selected community service experiences I had:

## Caregiver for Patient with Huntington's Disease

When I worked in the healthcare industry, I served a patient with [Huntington's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease)
who lives alone and volunteered to take care of her for one year. My work included doing house chores,
cooking and serving under special instructions, helping with communication, walking, exercise and emotional control. 
My volunteer job ended when the patient was transferred 
to a day care center as her disease progressed. 
This experience also brought me attention to the research topics concerning rare disease detection via machine learning methods.


## Vice President, Chinese Literature and Art Creativity Association

As the vice president of Chinese Literature and Art Creativity Association at UCLA, I took charge of holding weekly meetings, managing financial accounts,
and leading the advertising team. Our mission is to promote Chinese arts and literature to students who are interested in Chinese culture. We cooperated with
Chinese writers and artists and held seminars to encourage communication between students, professionals and scholars. 

## Member, Anteater for Autism

Anteaters for Autism is a non-profit organization focused on acceptance, raising awareness, volunteering, and fundraising for individuals with autism. 
I usually helped with holding social parties for adults with autism and their caregivers. I also accompanied and communicated adults suffering from autism, 
played games with them, and brought care and love to their lives.
