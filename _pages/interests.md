In my spare time, I am interested in various fancinating activities. I love writing, cooking, wine tasting, playing the keyboard and Chinese calligraphy. 
During the pandemic, I spent lots of time reading books and watching movies. In particular, I like documentaries, novels, history and art history books. 
My most recent interests focus on the literature, movies and documentaries about World War II. [Battle 360](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194698/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), 
[Saving Private Ryan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and [Midway](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6924650/) are my favorite.

Influenced by my parents, I am also very passionate about road trip because I enjoy the beautiful scenery and diverse culture along the road. 
I regard driving as a great way of relaxing. In China, I have travelled 22 provinces with my parents by car. In the United States, 
I drove from Los Angeles to San Francisco, Phoenix, Yellowstone, Denver, Chicago, etc. My longest road trip was around 3000 miles, 
from Los Angeles to Ithaca by myself. This experience became one of the most unforgettable memories in my life.
