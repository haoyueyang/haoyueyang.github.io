I am Haoyue Yang, and I sometimes go by Diane. I am a recent graduate from MS in Applied Statistics at Cornell University in December 2021. Before I continued my education at Cornell University, I studied at University of California, Los Angeles, double majoring in Mathematics/Economics and Statistics with a Specialization in Computing. At UCLA, I served as the vice president of Chinese Literature & Art Creativity Association. I worked in finance and health care industries for two years after graduation.

I am a passionate practioner of "Data for Good" movement. I am interested in applying machine learning and statistical learning models in making informed decisions for social good. My research projects cover random forests methodology, dynamic hierarchical models, and applications of machine learning and statistical learning methods in finance, health care and environmental studies. Please visit [Research](https:/haoyueyang.github.io/research) to check out my ongoing projects.

In my spare time, I am also an enthuastic Mathematics and Statistics tutor and an active volunteer. I particularly care about the elderly, low-income youth, and people suffering from mental health problems.
