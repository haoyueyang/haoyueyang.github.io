I enjoy teaching as a different way of learning. My teaching experience ranges from
middle school to undergraduate knowledge. 
In my spare time, students also 
discussed their troubles with me and sought my suggestions. 
I often listened to stories of their piquant siblings, strict parents, and heavy schoolwork, and I found happiness in advising them to make progress, overcome difficulties, and eventually be admitted by their dream colleges.
