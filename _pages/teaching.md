I enjoy teaching as a different way of learning. Everytime I communicated with my students, I learned something new of my current knowledge. My teaching experiences range from
middle school to undergraduate mathematics and statistics lessons. I am particularly passionate about helping middle school students from low-income families to practice mathematical training.
In my spare time, my students often
discussed their troubles with me and sought my suggestions, and I found happiness in advising them to make progress, overcome difficulties, and eventually be admitted by their dream colleges.
